CSE5335-PROJECT1-SXC3409
========================

1. I have used Ruby on Rails for backend as I wanted to learn a new technology.

2. I have used Jquery as front end framework as its light weight when compared to other javascript frameworks.

3. Ajax calls using Jquery was wasy.

4. Deploying the project on Heroku was a little difficult as it does not support SQLITE and ROR uses it as a default database.

5. I have installed postgresql as SQLITE was not supported by Heroku.

6. The project was developped in Ruby on Rails. Copy the project and navigate to the project folder and run "rails s" to start the server.
Go to browser and type A [link](localhost:3000).
